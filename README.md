# object-detection-using-yolo
The repository contains files to build a object detection model using the yolo pre-trained weights. Finally, we applied transfer learning to train the model on the Berkley Driving dataset to build an object detection model for a self driving car. 

Details to the code and the concepts covered in this code can be found in the blog : [Object Detection for Self Driving Car.](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/machine-learning/object-detection-for-self-driving-cars) 
The blog covers the following concepts: 
- Threshold Filtering
- Non Max Suppression 
- Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics
- Anchor Boxes
- YOLO Algorithm

You can watch the video with the object detection algorithm in action [here](https://vimeo.com/291081165)

If Object Detection seems to be a new word for you, you can learn the basics of object detection through the blog: [Introduction to Object Detection](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/machine-learning/introduction-to-object-detection/).
